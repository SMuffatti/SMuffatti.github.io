					<h1>I Am... A  Former Educator</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>I taught third through twelfth grade at the Beacon School in Stamford, CT. I specialized in history and technology, where I was the department head. I taught classes in robotics, 3D printing, object oriented programming, and web development. I led the FIRST robotics team and the lower school VEX IQ robotics team. I was constantly learning as I taught to bring more to the table and expand on the classes I was teaching.<p>

					<h1>I Am... A Homebrewer and Woodworker</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>I enjoy doing things myself and experimenting, to that end I have learned a great deal about woodworking and carpentry from my father. I use these skills to improve my life and build things that I can be proud of. At present I am building dog boxes to fit on the back of a truck to accommodate my girlfriend's mushing habit.</p>

					<p>I also homebrew beer and more recently, wine. I enjoy the constant process of learning and the experience of doing things yourself, refining your practices. In order to brew bigger and better beers, I set it upon myself to build an electric brewery and become an amatuer electriction. The entire process took roughly six months of research and construction.</p>

					<h1>I Am... A Dungeon Master</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Dungeons and Dragons has only been a hobby of mine since the release of 5th Edition. However, I was always a fan of RPGs such as Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights growing up. I only mention my affinity for Dungeons and Dragons due to the fact that some of the skills and abilities lend themselves well to the workplace and web development. The organization, planning, and preparation for each session is something that I look forward to throughout the week. The joint storytelling with the players as events unfold require constant adaptation of my plans and flexibility to improvise on the spot.</p>

				<div class="hidden pa">
					<h1>I Am... A Keeper of Plants and Animals</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>I keep and raise many plants and animals. Every year I grow a diverse vegetable garden containing garlic, onions, tomatoes, various greens, as well as many other root vegetables such as beets and carrots. I enjoy growing from seed each spring and nurturing the plants to fruition. I find peace and happiness working the soil and seeing my labor turn into something others can enjoy. I am also constantly expanding the varieties of plants I grow, even into the realm of fungus with a recent foray into shiitake mushrooms. I also have a vast collection of exotic cacti and succulents for show and to test the fortitude of my green thumb.</p>

					<p>My home is also populated by many siberian huskies, which my girlfriend races throughout New England. There are also a couple of cats which stalk the open beams of my house and a small flock of chickens who help to keep the garden pest free and produce my breakfast. Hopefully in the future I will be able to acquire a pair of goats.</p>

					<h1>I Am... A Web-Developer of the Earth</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>I like to build websites organically and let them grow as features and requirements increase. I don't try and force anything in my workflow or design and I find that it leads to a more natural and better user experience for both the client and the user. Web development is something that I enjoy and it is a means to an end to help achieve my goals of living sustainably and happily.</p>
